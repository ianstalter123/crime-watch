# sf map of crimes

![Alt text]('Screen Shot 2015-08-30 at 12.09.14 PM' "Optional title")


This was my first week long project at gschool ,  I basically used express.js, and google maps api, along with DataSF JSON data to make a map of crimes in the SF area, I also used 'markerclusterfier' as a plugin to show the clusters of markers. I also had some basic CRUD functionality on the markers / crimes where users can 'watch' a crime and add it to their collection via mongodb, in addition crimes can be displayed based on their type, and they also have custom icons depending on the type of crime. 

In addition I have a search functionality which displays charts showing the quantity of each type of crimes, using canvas.js.
